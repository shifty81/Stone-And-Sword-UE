# ✅ CAN I EDIT THIS PROJECT IN UNREAL ENGINE?

## YES! The project opens and is fully editable right now.

### What You Need:
Just create 2 simple assets (takes 5-10 minutes):

1. **DefaultEmpty.umap** - The main level (or use Python script)
2. **M_Terrain.uasset** - A terrain material (or use Python script)

### Why Aren't These Included?
Binary Unreal assets (.umap, .uasset) don't work well in Git. Creating them fresh ensures compatibility with your specific Unreal Engine version.

## 🚀 HOW TO SET UP

### Option 1: Automated (5 minutes) ⚡ RECOMMENDED

1. Open `StoneAndSword.uproject` in Unreal Engine 5.6
2. In Output Log, type: `py Content/Python/setup_project_assets.py`
3. Press Enter, wait for completion
4. Restart editor and press Play!

**Details:** [Content/Python/README.md](Content/Python/README.md)

### Option 2: Manual (10 minutes) 📝

Follow step-by-step instructions in [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)

## ✅ WHAT'S ALREADY COMPLETE

- ✅ All C++ source code (WorldGenerator, Character, GameMode, etc.)
- ✅ Build configuration files (.uproject, .Build.cs, .Target.cs)
- ✅ Input configuration (WASD, mouse, jump)
- ✅ Engine settings (plugins, game mode)
- ✅ Textures (grass, stone, dirt, normal maps)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (15+ guides)

## ⚠️ WHAT YOU CREATE (5-10 minutes)

- ⚠️ DefaultEmpty.umap - Main level (5 min or use Python)
- ⚠️ M_Terrain.uasset - Terrain material (3 min or use Python)

---

## 🎮 AFTER SETUP, YOU GET:

- Procedurally generated flat terrain (10km x 10km)
- Third-person character with smooth camera
- WASD + mouse movement controls
- Jump mechanic with physics
- Sky, lighting, and atmosphere
- Basic grass material on terrain
