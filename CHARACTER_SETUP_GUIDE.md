# Character Setup Guide - First-Person Game

## Overview

The **WorldPlayerCharacter** is fully implemented in C++ as a **first-person character** with complete gameplay functionality:
- ✅ First-person camera system
- ✅ WASD movement controls
- ✅ Mouse look/camera rotation
- ✅ Jump mechanics
- ✅ All gameplay logic in C++
- ✅ **Body visibility enabled by default** - Character meshes are now visible when assigned!

This guide shows you how to add **visible character models** using custom Blender files or free store assets.

---

## 🆕 NEW: Using Custom Blender Character Models (Recommended!)

If you have custom character models from Blender (like male.blend and female.blend):

### Quick Setup (15-20 minutes)

1. **Place your Blender files** in `Content/Player/` folder
2. **Follow the detailed import guide**: See `Content/Player/README.md`
3. **Import into Unreal Engine** - Blender files import directly!
4. **Create character blueprints** for male/female characters
5. **Set as default pawn** in Project Settings
6. **Press Play** and see your character!

**✅ Body visibility is now enabled by default** - Your character will be visible in first-person view when you look down!

For complete step-by-step instructions, see: **[Content/Player/README.md](Content/Player/README.md)**

---

## Quick Answer

**YES!** This is a **first-person game**. The character is already functional with full first-person controls.

**🆕 UPDATE**: Character body visibility is now **enabled by default**! When you assign a character mesh, you'll be able to see your body when looking down (like in games such as Minecraft or Mirror's Edge).

You can add:
1. **Custom Blender models** - Import your male.blend/female.blend files (See Content/Player/README.md)
2. **First-person arms/hands** - For holding weapons, tools, etc. (Optional)
3. **Store assets** - Use free assets from Mixamo or UE Marketplace

**The entire gameplay loop is already implemented in C++** - you just need to assign visual assets!

---

## Default Configuration

**🆕 Updated**: The character now works in **first-person mode with visible body enabled**:
- ✅ Camera at eye level
- ✅ **Body visible when you look down** (when mesh is assigned)
- ✅ WASD movement
- ✅ Mouse look
- ✅ Jump

**Press Play and it works immediately!** Add a character mesh to see your body in first-person view.

## Optional: Adding First-Person Arms/Hands

If you want to see hands/arms (for holding weapons, tools, etc.), follow these methods:

### Method 1: Using Unreal Engine First Person Template (Easiest - 5 minutes)

1. **Add First Person Content** (if not already added):
   - Create a temporary First Person project, or
   - Use Content Browser > Add > Add Feature or Content Pack > First Person

2. **Create a Blueprint of WorldPlayerCharacter**:
   - In Content Browser, right-click in `Content/Blueprints/`
   - Select **Blueprint Class**
   - Search for `WorldPlayerCharacter`
   - Name it `BP_FPSCharacter`

3. **Open BP_FPSCharacter** and configure:
   - In **Details** panel, find **Mesh** section
   - Set **First Person Arms Mesh** to `SKM_FPArms` (or similar from First Person template)
   - Set **First Person Arms Animation Class** to the FP arms animation blueprint
   - **Compile** and **Save**

4. **Set as Default Pawn**:
   - Open **Edit > Project Settings**
   - Go to **Maps & Modes** > **Default Modes**
   - Under **Selected GameMode** (StoneAndSwordGameModeBase)
   - Set **Default Pawn Class** to `BP_FPSCharacter`

5. **Test**:
   - Press **Play** (Alt+P)
   - You should see first-person arms with animations!

### Method 2: Using Mixamo Arms/Hands (Free - 20 minutes)

Mixamo provides free character models. You can use just the arms portion:

#### Step 1: Download Character from Mixamo

1. Go to **[mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com)**
2. Sign in with Adobe account (free)
3. Browse **Characters** and select one
4. Download:
   - Format: **FBX for Unreal (.fbx)**
   - Pose: **T-Pose**

#### Step 2: Download Animations

Download first-person appropriate animations:
1. **Idle** (arms idle)
2. **Walk** (arms swaying)
3. **Run** (arms pumping)
4. **Rifle Idle** (if you want weapon holding poses)

For each: FBX for Unreal, **Without Skin**, 30 FPS

#### Step 3: Import into Unreal

1. **Create folders**:
   - `Content/Characters/FirstPerson/`
   - `Content/Characters/FirstPerson/Animations/`

2. **Import Character**:
   - Import FBX to `Content/Characters/FirstPerson/`
   - Create skeleton and skeletal mesh

3. **Import Animations**:
   - Import to `Content/Characters/FirstPerson/Animations/`
   - Use the skeleton you created

#### Step 4: Extract Arms from Full Body (Optional)

If you want only arms visible:
1. Open the skeletal mesh
2. Delete unnecessary bones/meshes (legs, torso)
3. Keep only arms, hands, and shoulders
4. Save as `SK_FirstPersonArms`

#### Step 5: Create Animation Blueprint

1. Right-click in `Content/Characters/FirstPerson/`
2. **Animation > Animation Blueprint**
3. Choose your skeleton
4. Name it `ABP_FirstPersonArms`

5. **Configure AnimGraph**:
   - Create simple state machine or blend space
   - Idle when not moving
   - Walk/Run based on velocity

6. **Compile** and **Save**

#### Step 6: Apply to WorldPlayerCharacter

Same as Method 1, steps 2-5

### Method 3: Full Body in First-Person (See Your Legs)

If you want to see your own body (legs, torso) in first-person:

1. **Create BP_FPSCharacter** (as in Method 1)

2. **Configure**:
   - Set **Show Body In First Person** to ✅ **True**
   - This makes the full body mesh visible to you
   - Use a full character mesh (not just arms)

3. **Adjust Camera**:
   - Camera height may need adjustment
   - In C++, camera is at 64 units above capsule base
   - Adjust `FirstPersonCamera->SetRelativeLocation()` if needed

---

## Configuration Options

### 🆕 First-Person with Full Body (New Default!)
```
Show Body In First Person: ✅ True (Default)
Character Mesh: SK_Male or SK_Female (from Blender import)
Result: Can see your own legs and body in first-person
```

### First-Person with Arms Only
```
Show Body In First Person: ❌ False  
First Person Arms Mesh: SK_FirstPersonArms
First Person Arms Animation Class: ABP_FirstPersonArms
Result: Visible hands/arms only, no body
```

### Pure First-Person (Classic FPS)
```
Show Body In First Person: ❌ False
First Person Arms Mesh: (none)
Result: No visible body, classic FPS style (like Doom/Quake)
```

---

## C++ Implementation Details

The first-person system is fully implemented in C++:

### Camera Setup (C++)
```cpp
// WorldPlayerCharacter.cpp - Constructor
FirstPersonCamera = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCameraComponent>(TEXT("FirstPersonCamera"));
FirstPersonCamera->SetupAttachment(GetCapsuleComponent());
FirstPersonCamera->SetRelativeLocation(FVector(0.0f, 0.0f, 64.0f)); // Eye height
FirstPersonCamera->bUsePawnControlRotation = true; // FPS camera control
```

### Controller Rotation (C++)
```cpp
// WorldPlayerCharacter.cpp - Constructor  
bUseControllerRotationYaw = true;    // Character rotates with camera
bUseControllerRotationPitch = false; // Don't tilt character up/down
GetCharacterMovement()->bOrientRotationToMovement = false; // FPS mode
```

### Mesh Visibility (C++)
```cpp
// WorldPlayerCharacter.cpp - BeginPlay
GetMesh()->SetOwnerNoSee(!bShowBodyInFirstPerson); // Hide from self if disabled
GetMesh()->SetOnlyOwnerSee(true); // Arms only visible to owner
```

### Movement (C++)
```cpp
// WorldPlayerCharacter.cpp - MoveForward
void AWorldPlayerCharacter::MoveForward(float Value)
{
    if ((Controller != nullptr) && (Value != 0.0f))
    {
        const FRotator Rotation = Controller->GetControlRotation();
        const FRotator YawRotation(0, Rotation.Yaw, 0);
        const FVector Direction = FRotationMatrix(YawRotation).GetUnitAxis(EAxis::X);
        AddMovementInput(Direction, Value * MovementSpeedMultiplier);
    }
}
```

**All FPS logic is in C++!** Blueprints only assign visual assets (optional).

## Verification Checklist

After setup, verify everything works:

- [ ] Camera is at eye level (first-person view)
- [ ] WASD movement works
- [ ] Mouse look rotates camera
- [ ] Character rotates with camera (not with movement direction)
- [ ] Jump works
- [ ] Arms/hands visible if configured (optional)
- [ ] Body hidden/shown based on settings

---

## Gameplay Loop Confirmation

**The entire gameplay loop is implemented in C++:**

✅ **Input Handling** (C++):
- Jump, MoveForward, MoveRight, Turn, LookUp

✅ **Movement Logic** (C++):
- Forward/backward based on camera direction
- Strafing left/right
- Jump mechanics

✅ **Camera System** (C++):
- First-person camera at eye level
- Mouse look controls camera rotation
- Character rotates with camera yaw

✅ **Character Controller** (C++):
- FPS movement style
- Fast rotation rate
- Controller rotation for yaw

**No Blueprint logic required!** Blueprints only for optional visual assets.

---

## Adjusting Camera Height

If camera feels too low/high:

**In C++ (WorldPlayerCharacter.cpp):**
```cpp
FirstPersonCamera->SetRelativeLocation(FVector(0.0f, 0.0f, 64.0f)); // Change Z value
// 64.0f = eye height above capsule base
// Increase for taller, decrease for shorter
```

**In Blueprint:**
- Open `BP_FPSCharacter`
- Select **FirstPersonCamera** component
- Adjust **Location Z** value

---

## Troubleshooting

### Camera feels wrong
**Problem**: Camera height doesn't match character

**Solution**:
- Adjust `FirstPersonCamera` Z location
- Typical values: 60-80 units for adult human

### Can see inside character mesh
**Problem**: Body mesh clips through camera

**Solution**:
- Ensure `Show Body In First Person` is **False** if using full body
- Or use arms-only mesh
- Or adjust mesh position

### Character doesn't rotate with camera
**Problem**: Movement goes wrong direction

**Solution**:
- Verify `bUseControllerRotationYaw = true` in C++
- Check that movement is based on controller rotation (already implemented)

### Arms are invisible
**Problem**: Arms mesh not showing

**Solution**:
- Check that `First Person Arms Mesh` is set
- Verify `SetOwnerNoSee(false)` and `SetOnlyOwnerSee(true)` are called
- Check mesh isn't scaled to 0 or positioned wrong
